  `1. (d) Give four features of a population on which systematic random sampling can be correctly applied.`,
  `1. (e) Write briefly on the types of data based on data source.`,
  `1. (f) Describe validity of data in not more than three sentences.`,
  `2. (a) Highlight four guidelines for making graphs.`,
  `2. (b) A Biochemist obtained the following result from a research to determine the erythrocyte membrane stabilizing potential of three ethanol based plant extracts. He also added a positive control (Ibuprofen) to ascertain the relative activity of each extract. When the cell membrane is protected, the amount of haemoglobin released will be low and the absorbance recorded will be low i.e. the absorbance measurement is inversely proportional to stabilizing potential. <br>
  Present the data below in the most appropriate graphical representation. <br>
  At what concentrations did the extracts show better activity than the control? <br>`,
